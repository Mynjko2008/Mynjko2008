# 👋 Hi, I'm Arthur Mynjko!

🎓 I’m currently a student in the Technical Course in Systems Development at EE Yervant Kissajikian, São Paulo, Brazil.  
💻 Passionate about technology, I started my journey with logic and C# programming, and have since expanded my knowledge into full-stack web development.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a young developer focused on building complete web solutions. I have hands-on experience with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL**, and I’m currently deepening my skills in back-end development and cybersecurity through self-study.  

I enjoy working on challenging projects, like my technical final project (TCC) — a website for item exchange between users, featuring login, registration, and PHP/MySQL database integration.  
This project was showcased at the **Cultural Fair**, where it won **1st place** among all class projects.

🧠 Curious and self-taught, I study through online platforms like Udemy, Hashtag Treinamentos, Fundação Bradesco, and I'm constantly updating my portfolio here on GitHub.
